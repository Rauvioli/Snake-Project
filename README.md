# FOX PROJECT

# The project I have created was created with the goal of being fun first and foremost and also simpler because I'm pretty bad at coding
# the first game that came to my head that I thought would be fun to make was solitaire but that didn't seem like it would be easy so I went 
# the next best thing and created a SNAKE like game which I renamed to fox because foxes are awesome.
# In FOX you are a lone fox with the only goal of eating as many chickens as you can because the more chikens you eat the more LONG you get.
# I love the funny concept that the fox that you play as doesn't get bigger in conventional means but gets longer.
# My programs code consists of three bulky class function as well as some main function that serves as support for the rest of the game.
# The class FOX is the code behind the FOX entity as it gives the fox it's png skin, the ability to grow and it's ability to move around.
# The class CHKN is the simplest as it simply puts the chicken in random spots on the map.
# Finally the class main serves to code in the main elements of the game as it detects collisions and can either register a chicken 
# allowing for the fox to grow or detecting a wall or the fox's body causing the fox to die.
# The rest of the code serves to provide the fox with it's control functions as well as to create the background and the clock.
